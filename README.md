# Disease-Outbreak-Airport-Web-Analytics-

This project analyses the structure of the airline network, detects influential nodes, and simulates disease spread to provide insights for controlling outbreaks.

Centrality Analysis: Compute centrality measures to determine the most influential airports.
Virus Spread Simulation: Use centrality measures to model how a disease could spread through the airline network.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide recommendations based on the analysis for controlling disease spread.
